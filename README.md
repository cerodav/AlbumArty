# AlbumArty

<p>Hi Folks, this program aims at helping out people with huge loads of pirated songs, as in those songs obtained through non-commercial sources, to set the album art or to be specific the cover image right</p>
####The only prerequisite being, get the song named properly
How to use this :
  1. Setting up the environment
    1. Please enter `pip -r install requirements.txt`, after you have moved into the directory containing the requirements.txt file
    2. This ensures that the albumarty.py functions properly, as depedencies are downloaded and ready to use.
  2. Running the albumarty.py code
    1. Please enter `python albumarty.py [--max] [location]`, after you have moved into the directory containing the albumarty.py file
    2. [location] refers to the location or directory containing all the music files that you would like to work on
    3. [--max] provides you an option to decide if the album art set at any instance by albumarty is the right albumart you are looking for, if not, albumarty does further searching and sets another albumart and prompts the user until the user accepts the albumart
    4. Enjoy :)
    
Also, feel free to add enhancements!
